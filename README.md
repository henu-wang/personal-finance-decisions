## The Personal Finance Decision Stack

Financial decisions cascade. Getting the big ones right matters far more than optimizing the small ones. Focus your energy accordingly.

### Tier 1: Foundation Decisions (Highest Impact)
- Career and income trajectory
- Where you live (cost of living)
- Housing: rent vs. buy
- Life partner (shared financial values)

### Tier 2: Structural Decisions
- Emergency fund size (3-6 months expenses)
- Retirement savings rate (aim for 20%+)
- Insurance coverage (health, disability, life)
- Debt management strategy

### Tier 3: Optimization Decisions (Lower Impact)
- Tax-advantaged account selection
- Investment vehicle choice
- Credit card rewards optimization
- Subscription management

## The 10x Rule for Spending Decisions

Before any purchase, multiply the cost by 10:

| Purchase | Cost | 10x Check | Decision |
|----------|------|-----------|----------|
| Daily coffee | $5/day | $50/day = $18,250/year | Make at home |
| Gym membership | $50/month | $500/month = $6,000/year | Worth it if used 3x/week |
| New car | $400/month | $4,000/month = $48,000/year | Buy used instead |
| Online course | $200 one-time | $2,000 | Buy if it increases earning |

## The FIRE Decision Framework

### Financial Independence Calculation
```
Annual expenses × 25 = Your FIRE number
```

| Monthly Expenses | Annual | FIRE Number | Years to FIRE (50% savings rate) |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| $3,000 | $36,000 | $900,000 | ~17 years |
| $4,000 | $48,000 | $1,200,000 | ~17 years |
| $5,000 | $60,000 | $1,500,000 | ~17 years |
| $6,000 | $72,000 | $1,800,000 | ~17 years |

**Key insight:** Reducing expenses by $500/month reduces your FIRE number by $150,000.

## Debt Payoff Decision Matrix

| Method | Strategy | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Avalanche** | Pay highest interest first | Minimizing total interest paid |
| **Snowball** | Pay smallest balance first | Building psychological momentum |
| **Hybrid** | Pay one small win, then switch to avalanche | Motivation + math optimization |

## Investment Decision Simplifier

```
Are you investing for 10+ years?
├── YES → Stock-heavy portfolio (80-90% stocks)
│   └── Do you want simplicity?
│       ├── YES → Target-date fund or total market index
│       └── NO → 3-fund portfolio (US/International/Bonds)
└── NO → How many years?
    ├── 5-10 years → Balanced (60/40 stocks/bonds)
    ├── 2-5 years → Conservative (30/70 stocks/bonds)
    └── <2 years → High-yield savings or CDs
```

## The Lifestyle Inflation Audit

Every time your income increases, answer:

1. How much of this raise will I **save/invest**? (Target: 50%+)
2. How much will I allocate to **lifestyle**? (Target: <50%)
3. What specific lifestyle upgrade provides the **most happiness per dollar**?
4. Am I upgrading because I **want to** or because I feel I **should**?
