## Why Financial Decisions Are Hard

Personal finance is simple in theory but difficult in practice because:

- **Emotional spending**: Purchases trigger dopamine; saving does not
- **Temporal discounting**: We overvalue present consumption over future wealth
- **Complexity**: Too many options for investing, insurance, and tax planning
- **Social pressure**: Lifestyle inflation driven by comparison
- **Uncertainty**: Future income, expenses, and market returns are unknown

The solution is not more willpower but better systems and decision frameworks.

## Core Financial Principles

### 1. Pay Yourself First

Automate savings before spending decisions arise:

```
Income → Automatic savings (20%+) → Remaining for expenses
NOT: Income → Expenses → Whatever's left for savings
```

### 2. Avoid Lifestyle Inflation

When income increases, increase savings rate before increasing spending:

| Income Increase | Savings Allocation | Spending Allocation |
|---|---|---|
| First $10K raise | 70% to savings | 30% to lifestyle |
| Subsequent raises | 50% to savings | 50% to lifestyle |
| Bonus/windfall | 80% to savings | 20% to lifestyle |

### 3. Minimize Recurring Costs

One-time purchases are less dangerous than recurring expenses:

```
$200/month subscription = $2,400/year = $24,000 over 10 years
Invested at 7% instead = $34,500 over 10 years
```

### 4. Opportunity Cost Thinking

Every dollar spent has an alternative use. The true cost of a $50 dinner is not $50 -- it's what that $50 could have become if invested.

## The Financial Decision Framework

### For Any Financial Decision Over $500

```
1. What problem am I solving? (need vs want)
2. What are my options? (at least 3)
3. What is the total cost? (purchase + maintenance + opportunity cost)
4. Can I wait 48 hours? (cooling period)
5. What would I advise a friend to do?
6. Does this align with my financial goals?
```

### Decision Size Guide

| Decision Size | Process | Time to Decide |
|---|---|---|
| Under $50 | Quick gut check | Immediate |
| $50 - $500 | Sleep on it, compare options | 24 hours |
| $500 - $5,000 | Full framework, research | 1 week |
| $5,000 - $50,000 | Deep analysis, consult advisors | 1 month |
| Over $50,000 | Professional advice, multiple opinions | 3+ months |

## Budgeting Decisions

### The 50/30/20 Framework

| Category | Percentage | Includes |
|---|---|---|
| Needs | 50% | Housing, food, transport, insurance, minimum debt payments |
| Wants | 30% | Entertainment, dining out, hobbies, subscriptions |
| Savings/Debt | 20% | Emergency fund, investments, extra debt payments |

### Budget Decision Rules

- If needs exceed 50%, your housing or transportation costs are too high
- If savings are below 20%, cut wants before cutting needs
- Track spending for 3 months before setting a budget
- Review and adjust quarterly, not monthly

## Saving Decisions

### Emergency Fund Priority

```
Level 1: $1,000 starter emergency fund (1-2 months)
Level 2: 3 months of expenses (single income / stable job)
Level 3: 6 months of expenses (variable income / single earner)
Level 4: 12 months (self-employed / high-risk situation)
```

### Where to Save

| Goal Timeline | Vehicle | Expected Return |
|---|---|---|
| 0-1 year | High-yield savings | 4-5% |
| 1-3 years | CDs, T-Bills, money market | 4-5% |
| 3-5 years | Short-term bond funds | 4-6% |
| 5+ years | Index funds (stock/bond mix) | 7-10% |

## Debt Decisions

### Debt Payoff Methods

| Method | Strategy | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Avalanche** | Pay highest interest first | Mathematically optimal, saves most money |
| **Snowball** | Pay smallest balance first | Psychologically motivating, builds momentum |
| **Hybrid** | Quick wins first, then avalanche | Balance of motivation and optimization |

### Good Debt vs Bad Debt

| Good Debt | Bad Debt |
|---|---|
| Mortgage (appreciating asset, tax deduction) | Credit cards (depreciating purchases, high interest) |
| Student loans (income increase potential) | Car loans on luxury vehicles |
| Business loans (income-generating) | Personal loans for lifestyle spending |

### The Debt Decision Rule

```
If debt interest rate > expected investment return → Pay debt first
If debt interest rate < expected investment return → Invest first
Breakeven is typically around 6-7% interest rate
```

## Investment Decisions

### Getting Started Checklist

```markdown
Before investing, confirm:
- [ ] Emergency fund in place (3-6 months)
- [ ] High-interest debt paid off (> 7%)
- [ ] Employer 401k match maximized (free money)
- [ ] Clear investment timeline (5+ years for stocks)
- [ ] Risk tolerance honestly assessed
```

### Simple Investment Framework

| Your Situation | Recommended Approach |
|---|---|
| Just starting out | Target-date retirement fund (one fund, set and forget) |
| Building wealth | Three-fund portfolio (US stocks, international, bonds) |
| Optimizing | Factor tilts, tax-loss harvesting, asset location |

### Investment Decision Rules

- Never invest money you need within 5 years in stocks
- Diversify across asset classes and geographies
- Keep total investment fees below 0.2% annually
- Rebalance annually, not more often
- Ignore market news; follow your plan

Documenting your investment rationale when you make decisions helps prevent emotional reversals during market downturns. A decision journal or platform like [KeepRule](https://keeprule.com) can help you capture your reasoning when you're thinking clearly, giving you an anchor when markets get volatile.

## Major Purchase Decisions

### Home Buying Decision Matrix

| Factor | Rent | Buy |
|---|---|---|
| Staying 5+ years | Neutral | Favors buying |
| Staying < 3 years | Favors renting | Avoid buying |
| Price-to-rent ratio > 20 | Favors renting | Expensive to buy |
| Price-to-rent ratio < 15 | Expensive to rent | Favors buying |
| Job stability | Less commitment needed | Requires stable income |

### The 28/36 Rule

- Housing costs should be under 28% of gross income
- Total debt payments should be under 36% of gross income

### Car Purchase Decision

```
True monthly cost = Payment + Insurance + Gas + Maintenance + Depreciation

Rules:
- Total vehicle value < 50% of annual income
- Buy 2-3 years used (avoid steepest depreciation)
- Pay cash or keep loan under 48 months
- Consider total cost of ownership, not just purchase price
```

## Insurance Decisions

### Insurance Decision Framework

| Situation | Insure? | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Catastrophic loss you can't self-fund | Yes | Health, home, auto liability |
| Large loss that would set you back years | Yes | Disability, umbrella |
| Small loss you can absorb | No | Extended warranties, phone insurance |
| Very unlikely event | Maybe | Depends on cost and consequence |

### The Self-Insurance Rule

```
If you can afford to replace it without financial stress → skip insurance
If losing it would be financially devastating → get insurance
```

## Common Behavioral Traps

| Trap | Description | Antidote |
|---|---|---|
| Anchoring | Comparing to inflated "original" prices | Research fair market value independently |
| Sunk cost fallacy | Continuing bad investments because you already spent money | Evaluate based on future value only |
| Mental accounting | Treating money differently based on source | All dollars are equal |
| Present bias | Overweighting immediate gratification | Automate future-oriented decisions |
| Herd behavior | Following the crowd into investments | Stick to your plan regardless |
| Loss aversion | Feeling losses 2x more than gains | Define risk tolerance in advance |

Recognizing these traps is the first step to avoiding them. Building a habit of structured decision-making through tools like [KeepRule](https://keeprule.com) helps create the pause between impulse and action where better financial choices happen.
